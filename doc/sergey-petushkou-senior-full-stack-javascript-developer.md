Usually I work with a cross-functional team of engineers, designers, product managers, and stakeholders to deliver user-centric and data-driven solutions, robust and reliable back-end services and APIs, as well as elegant and responsive front-end interfaces.

I am a team player with good understanding of Agile / Scrum concepts. I possess strong interpersonal skills and high ethical standards, enabling me to address both technical challenges and communication barriers.

I am passionate about learning new technologies and best practices, and I enjoy sharing my knowledge and feedback with my peers and the community.
