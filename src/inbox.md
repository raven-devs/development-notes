Congratulations
You have made a great choice in choosing this course. You are joining 80,000 learners who have chosen in28Minutes as their learning partner. Thank You for 6500+ 5-Star Reviews on our courses. We are confident that you will love this course.
Three things you would need to know before starting the course:

1. Set Yourselves a Goal - Spend at least 28 minutes everyday, with this course, for the next week.
1. Udemy asks a review very early in the course and at multiple intervals. If you feel you are not ready to leave a review, feel free to skip the review using the ’Skip’ or ‘I’ll respond later’ or ‘Cancel' buttons at the bottom of your review screen.
1. Subtitles for this course are still primitive - at alpha level. Udemy is providing these as a test. We are working on them and they should improve over a period of time.
   Have a little bit of patience for the first two hours and you should love it :) Good Luck with the Course.
   Example of a Support page:
   Fastest Approach to Solve All Your Exceptions
   If you are using Intellij or you are using Java 9 or you are facing a ClassNotFoundException, we are here to help. This 50 page troubleshooting guide and faq is our way of thanking you for choosing to learn from in28Minutes. It provides solutions for 200 FAQ and Frequently faced Problems.
   Here's the Quick Start with Top 10 FAQ
   https://github.com/in28minutes/in28minutes-initiatives/blob/master/The-in28Minutes-TroubleshootingGuide-And-FAQ/quick-start.md
   We love all our 150,000 learners. We want to help you in every way possible.We do not want you to get stuck because of a simple error. Udemy feedback:
   A course logo page is displaying 2 seconds in the beginning of each lesson, e.g.
   Start each new lesson mentioning what we did in a previous one and what we are going to do now.
   Praise students each time after a particular hard / long exercise (subject) is finished.
   In the first lesson introduce yourself, give a short description what we are going to learn, what tech stack will be used and demonstrate a final result - a completed project that we will be working on during the whole course and finish at the end.
   Periodically show a steps wizard (diagram): what steps will be completed during the project, what step we are processing now and how many steps are in total.
   When introducing a new tech (CSS, XML, etc.) make students be aware not to worry if they do not know the tech at all or perfectly for 100%. Create a meaningful title of the source: list key technologies, “building, real-world, complete, project, step by step"
   Update the project with the most possible latest current data
   Analyse all options available for the course or book listing among others: publication date, rating, tags, title, price, etc.
   create a partner program for all digital sources
   provide coupons at the end of the course for your other courses
   provide links in your course to your other courses or courses of your partners (partner referral links)

**\*** Here are a Few Reviews on The in28Minutes Way **\***
Excellent, fabulous. The way he has prepared the material and the way he teaches is really awesome. What an effort .. Thanks a million
A lot of preparation work has taken place from the teacher and this is visible throughout the course.
This guy is fantastic. Really. Wonderful teaching skills, and goes well out of his way to make sure that everything he is doing is fully understood. This is the kind of tutorial that gets me excited to work with a framework that I may otherwise not be.
The best part of it is the hands-on approach which the author maintained throughout the course as he had promised at the beginning of the lecture. He explains the concepts really well and also makes sure that there is not a single line of code you type without understanding what it really does.
I also appreciate the mind and hands approach of teaching something and then having the student apply it. It makes everything a lot clearer for the student and uncovers issues that we will face in our project early.
Amazing course. Explained super difficult concepts (that I have spent hours on the internet finding a good explanation) in under 5 minutes. Zero risk. 30 day money-back guarantee with every purchase of the course. You have nothing to lose!

   Create series of cources / books. Provide ads and links to all of your other cources / books in every of your cource / book. A reference idea: make a short intro to a corce / book, describe what you will learn, what problems the cource / book solves and what advantages you can get when getting into the cource / book.
   Make a personal brand: your photo, name, company, accounts (Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, GitHub).
   Each video lesson should be less than 20 mins - Udemy rules. Read other Udemy rules.
   Zoom in your video when demonstrating source code in a course. It is difficult to see the screen with a big scale. Implement a sound track in every lesson in the beginning and ending:
